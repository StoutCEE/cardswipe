# HTML5 Website Layout (ARCHIVED)
This repo was for playing around with the layout code (especially with the CSS). Though the layout (especially the color scheme) isn't beautiful, it has a few nice features!

## Features:
 - No dependency on JavaScript (though most clients run JS now)
 - Dropdown navigation
 - Footer sticks to bottom (more difficult than anticipated)
 - Login link floats right
 
This is a decent barebones concept to have on hand. Definitely recommended to make some changes before use (specifically the colors, they're awful)
