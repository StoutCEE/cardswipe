# PHP/XML Check-In (ARCHIVED)
This was from our original lab check-in tracking idea. We planned to have a web login that used PHP scripts to check an XML database. We soon realized that MySQL would be a better option, despite having a higher learning curve.

## Problems with XML Databases:
 - Security
 - Easy to make illegal changes
 - Easy to delete .xml files accidentally

## Problems with MySQL Databases:
 - More difficult for beginners
 - Another program to configure on our Linux server
 
In the end, the complications with MySQL didn't outweigh the benefits of security and organization. An added benefit of using MySQL is that it introduced the students working on the project to MySQL Databases
